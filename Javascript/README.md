# Javascript

## Values, Types and Operators

 - **Values:** chunks of bits that represent pieces of information
 - **Strings** are used to represent text like "Float on the ocean" you can use single quotes, double quotes, or backticks to mark strings
 - 4 types of JS values: numbers, strings, Booleans, and undefined values

## Program Structure

 - **Expression:** a fragment of code that produces a value
 - A **program** is a list of statements
 - Binding or variables catch and hold values by using keywords
 - After a binding has been defined, its name can be used as an expression
 - The = operator can be used at any time on existing bindings to disconnect them from their current values and point them to a new one
 - **var** is short for variable and was used in the same was **let** is used now, probably won't use var very often
 - **const** stands for constant - it defines a constant binding which points at the same value for as long as it lives
 - **Environment:** the collection of bindings and their values that exist at a given time
 - **Function:** a piece of program wrapped in a value
 - Executing a function is called invoking, calling, or applying it
 - **Arguments:** values given to functions
 - When a function produces a value, it is said to **return** that value
 - **Conditional Execution:** when the program takes the proper branch based on the situation at hand (**if** keyword)

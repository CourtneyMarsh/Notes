# Thinking Like a Programmer

## What is Programming?

- Writing code to solve a problem

-Think methodically similar to a scientist

-Being a good problem solver

## Breaking Down Problems

-Break down problems to pinpoint the issue instead of relating the problem to the entire project

-Think about what the application is going to do ie. Expense report: add an expense, edit an expense, and delete an expense

## Thinking Algorithmically

-Think of writing code like cooking with a receipe, if you make one simple mistake like using the wrong temperature, the meal won't come out the same

-Think in a step-by-step process

-The computer is really dumb and can't guess what you want it to do

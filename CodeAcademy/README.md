## Introduction

- **Remainder/Modulo %** operator returns the number that remains after the right-hand number divides into the left-hand number as many times as it evenly can
- **Null** is a primitive data type that represents the intentional absence of value
- **Numbers** are a primitive data type that include the set of all integers and floating point numbers
- **Single Line Comments** are created with two consecutive forward slashes **//**
- **.length** property of a string returns the number of characters that make up the string
- **Methods** return information about an object and are called by appending an instance with a period **.** the method name, and parantheses - Math **.random( );** normally as Math.random( );
- **Built-in Objects** contain methods that can be called by appending the object name with a period **.**, the method name, and a set of parantheses - **Math** .random( );
- **const** keyword - a constant variable is declared by using the keyword **const**.  It must have an assignment.  Any attempt of re-assigning a **const** variable will result in a Javascript runtime error - const numberOfColumns =4;
- **Calling functions:** functions can be called or executed elsewhwere in code using parantheses following the function name.  When a function is called, the code inside its function body runs.  **Arguments** are values passed into a function when it is called 
- function sum(num1, num2) {
  - return num1 + num2;
- }
- **sum(2, 4); - this is calling the function**
- **Function parameters:** inputs to functions are known as parameters when a function is declared or defined.  **Parameters** are used as variables inside the function body.  When the function is called, these parameters will have the value of whatever is passed in as arguments.  It is possible to define a function without parameters
- function sayHello(name) {
  - return 'Hello, ${name}!';
- }  
- **the parameter is name**
